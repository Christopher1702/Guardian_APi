# MacroTrack Ai

My mission is to simplify nutrition tracking through intelligent automation and intuitive design. We empower users to understand their eating habits without the hassle of manual data entry—combining Google’s Gemini AI for instant nutrient recognition and Firebase for secure, seamless cloud storage. Our platform merges a clean, engaging React Native interface with a robust FastAPI backend, ensuring real-time performance and accessibility across devices. By transforming meal logging into a natural conversation-like experience, we aim to make daily health management effortless, accurate, and deeply personalized.
